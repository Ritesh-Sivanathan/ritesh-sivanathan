#### Hey! I'm a 15 y/o student interested in all things tech. I currently know a few languages and frameworks/libraries which include:
- 🐍 Python ( Flask, Tensorflow, PyTorch )
- 📜 Javascript ( React, Node.js, Express.js )
- 🔵 Lua
- 💻 C
- 🌐 HTML / CSS

### The current project I am working on is:
#### mscipro.pythonanywhere.com
#### It is a a STEM education website which will provide countless STEM resources, problem generators, worksheets, coding playgrounds and a bunch of other stuff.
#### I am currently rewriting it to use the MERN stack for the purpose of learning JavaScript. I have finished rewriting about 20% of the website and I plan to have it ready by early March.
